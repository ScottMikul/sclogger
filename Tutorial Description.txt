ok so for part one I will demonstrate how to create a bloglike website using angularjs and bootstrap. Many blogs are basically a navigation bar, the sclogger.post content in the main section of the page, and then a listing of other posts on the sidebar. First, I will show how to do the list of blog posts. Next I will use a web server and communicate with a mongo database with java.
